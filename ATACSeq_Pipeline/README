	Pipeline for comparing ATACseq
	Last edited on 06/01/2022 -- GAREEVES

PIPELINE OVERVIEW
	This pipeline is used to generate several outputs and compile several metadata files comparing data between
	multiple ATAC-seq libraries.
	
	For detailed running instructions and system/package requirements see associated publication:
	XXXX
	
HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS	
	The pipeline is designed to work on a MACOSX device (minimum version BigSir 11.4)

TEST CASE
	Test case data available on associated Figshare:
	XXXX
